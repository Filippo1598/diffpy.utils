Tools Utility
#############

The ``diffpy.utils.tools`` module is designed for users to manage and track their username and email information.
This module helps by storing this information in a ``diffpyconfig.json`` file generated by the function.

Users can use the module to simplify the process of loading, merging, and saving information consistently and easily.
Additionally, it saves the effort of re-entering information, and allows overriding current information by
passing parameters.

Users can apply the function ``get_user_info`` for this purpose.
Other helper functions, such as ``load_config``, ``clean_dict``, are also available.
